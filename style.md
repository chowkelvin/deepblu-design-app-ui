### ICONS
Deepblu's icons are fully designed from the ground up to compliment its visual identity.
The signature of a Deepblu icon is its 2 pt outline. The outline is used through all the states of every icon. In addition to the outlines, icons in active and selected states will have a color fill from Deepblu's color set.

### TYPOGRAPHY
The typography for Deepblu is chosen to reinforce Deepblu's visual identity.
Avenir is the standard typeface used for Deepblu's branding as well as all other applications. The Avenir typeface is selected for its round 'bowl' of its lettering, consistent with Deepblu's design language.

### IMAGERY
Images are a powerful tool to help communicate and create emotions as it fits.
